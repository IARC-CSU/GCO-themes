		        			<h3 class="ng-binding-old">Incidence</h3>
          					<p class="ng-binding-old">Cancer incidence is the number of new cancer cases arising in a specified population over a given period of time (typically 1 year). It can be expressed as an absolute number of cases within the entire population per year or as a rate per 100 000 persons per year (see Crude Rate and Age-Standardized Rate below). The cancer incidence rate provides an approximation of the average risk of developing a cancer. Incidence data are routinely collected by national or subnational population-based cancer registries.</p>

          					<h3 class="ng-binding-old">Mortality</h3>
          					<p class="ng-binding-old">Cancer mortality is the number of deaths due to cancer occurring in a specified population over a given period of time (typically 1 year). It can be expressed as an absolute number of deaths within the entire population per year or as a rate per 100 000 persons per year. Mortality data by cause are routinely collected by national vital registration systems.</p>

	          				<h3 class="ng-binding-old">Prevalence</h3>
          					<p class="ng-binding-old">The prevalence of a given cancer is the number of individuals within a defined population who have been diagnosed with that cancer and who are still alive at a given point in time (i.e. the survivors). Complete prevalence is the number of individuals alive, at a given point in time, who have been diagnosed with the disease of interest, regardless of the amount of time since the diagnosis or whether the individual is still under treatment or is considered cured. Partial prevalence limits the number of patients to those diagnosed within a defined period of time in the past, and this is a particularly useful measure of cancer burden. <br/><br/> </p>

		        		</div>

		        		<div class="col-md-6">

		        			<h3 class="ng-binding-old">Age-Standardized Rate</h3>
      						<p class="ng-binding-old">An age-standardized rate (ASR) is a summary measure of the rate that would have been observed if the population had a standard age structure. Standardization is necessary when comparing several populations that differ with respect to age, because age has a strong influence on the risk of cancer. An ASR is a weighted mean of the age-specific rates; the weighting is based on the population distribution of a standard population. The most frequently used standard population is the World (W) Standard Population. The calculated incidence or mortality rate is then called the age-standardized incidence or mortality rate (W), and is expressed per 100 000 person-years. The World Standard Population used in GLOBOCAN was first proposed by Segi (1960)<sup>a</sup> and later modified by Doll et al. (1966)<sup>b</sup>.</p>

      						<h3 class="ng-binding-old">Crude Rate</h3>
          					<p class="ng-binding-old">For a specific tumour in a given population, crude rates are calculated simply by dividing the number of new cancers or cancer deaths observed during a given time period by the corresponding number of individuals in the population at risk. For cancer, the result is commonly expressed as an annual rate per 100 000 individuals at risk.</p>

          					<h3 class="ng-binding-old">Cumulative Risk</h3>
          					<p class="ng-binding-old">Cumulative incidence/mortality is the probability or risk of individuals developing/dying from the disease during a specified period. For cancer, it is expressed as the number of newborn children (out of 100) who would be expected to develop/die from a particular cancer over a lifetime (commonly defined for the age range 0-74 years), assuming that they had the rates of cancer observed in the period of observation and that there is an absence of competing causes of death.</p>

		        			<h3 class="ng-binding-old">Are the GLOBOCAN estimates for previous years (e.g. 2012) still available online?</h3>
          					<p class="ng-binding-old">No. The increasing availability of incidence data from cancer registries and mortality data from vital statistics offices, coupled with a continued re-assessment of the GLOBOCAN estimation methods, means that the current incidence and mortality estimates (for 2018) cannot be directly compared with estimates from previous versions (e.g. GLOBOCAN 2012 or GLOBOCAN 2008).<p>
          					<p>To avoid potential confusion among users, only the latest and most reliable statistics are provided on the current global cancer incidence and mortality burden (for 2018). If you have a specific need for GLOBOCAN 2008 or GLOBOCAN 2012 data, please email your request to <a href="mailto:csu@iarc.fr">csu@iarc.fr</a>.</p>

	          				<h3 class="ng-binding-old">What are the major differences between GLOBOCAN 2018 and GLOBOCAN 2012?</h3>
          					<p class="ng-binding-old">There are several differences between GLOBOCAN 2018 and GLOBOCAN 2012, which relate to the availability of incidence and/or mortality data and to the methods used for estimating rates in the absence of data.
							<!--<br>
							A summary is provided <a href="data-sources-methods">here</a>.--></p>

							<h3 class="ng-binding-old">What are the differences between the mortality data available in GLOBOCAN 2018 and those available from the WHO Mortality Database?</h3>
          					<p class="ng-binding-old">The mortality data presented in GLOBOCAN 2018 are estimates based on recorded data available from the WHO Mortality Database for earlier periods, combined with prediction methods. The WHO mortality data may have been corrected to take into account some degree of incompleteness or under-coverage. These corrections have also been incorporated into GLOBOCAN 2018.</p>

		        		</div>

		        		<div class="col-md-6">

		        			<h3 class="ng-binding-old">What is the relationship between GLOBOCAN and Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5)?</h3>
          					<p class="ng-binding-old">The volumes of the CI5 series present detailed and high-quality information on the incidence of cancer recorded by cancer registries (regional or national) around the world during a specific period of time (typically 5 years). CI5 is the major source of information for developing the country-specific cancer incidence estimates presented in GLOBOCAN. The national incidence rates published in CI5 may not correspond exactly to those published in GLOBOCAN 2018, because they are presented for a different time period and may be computed using a different set of populations.</p>
		        			
          					<h3 class="ng-binding-old">How frequently will GLOBOCAN be updated?</h3>
          					<p class="ng-binding-old">Periodically, minor modifications will be made to the underlying data within GLOBOCAN 2018, in order to correct identified errors. Updates of GLOBOCAN 2018 will be carried out once sufficient recorded national incidence and mortality data are available. </p>

          					<h3 class="ng-binding-old">What specific caveats should be noted when using GLOBOCAN 2018?</h3>
          					<p class="ng-binding-old">
      						The estimated numbers of cancer cases and cancer deaths in a given region may not correspond to the sum of the estimated numbers of cancer cases and deaths in the individual countries of that region; the population of a region may include some small country populations for which no estimates are provided.
							</p>

							<p>
								The 36 individual cancer types estimated in GLOBOCAN 2018 include malignant neoplasms only, except for bladder cancer which may include carcinoma in situ, or tumours of uncertain or unknown behaviour, in the incidence (but not the mortality), depending on the definitions of malignancy in each cancer registry. The newly-included category “Non-melanoma skin cancer” (NMSC) excludes basal cell carcinomas in incidence, while mortality includes deaths from all types of NMSC.
